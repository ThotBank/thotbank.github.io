# original

This directory holds the original JSON database (as provided by the Mad√πwwe project) and its flattened version as collection
of TSV files. Note that these files serve as basis for the data package stored in /data, but upon future work it will
*not* be possible to just replace them. As such, this directory serves mostly as a history of development.
